# Curriculum Design for haohaohow

haohaohow is structured to teach Mandarin Chinese in a way that balances vocabulary, character recognition, and skill dependencies.

## Handling Words with Multiple Meanings

Words like **遍 (biàn)** have distinct meanings depending on context. Instead of merging them under one gloss, we split them into separate learning skills.

- **遍 as a measure word** → "I read this book three times."
- **遍 as 'everywhere'** → "He searched everywhere."

This approach ensures structured learning progression and prevents premature merging in SRS.
